instagram,'83.0',3/6/2019,3,"I began using IG instead of FB because of all the pop-up ads. Now I have the same issue with IG. Ads appear instead of posts from people I follow. My page is supposed to be private so apparently I have allowed the content to be used for commercial purposes in the long agreements that I didn't read, buyer/user beware. So I may have to take a social media break from it all. And, the posts from my real friends sporadically appears because I have made the mistake in judgement to follow so ""celebrities"" and it seems their content may take precedence?"

instagram,'83.0',3/11/2019,2,You should be able to see if some one is following you just by opening that persons profile. Instead of scrolling thru your followers list.  Ability to hide a picture instead of deleting it. Have an alphabetical or chronological order to your friends and followers list.
instagram,'83.0',3/11/2019,1,WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU TAKE THE VIEWER LIST OFF ??? I SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS IT WHENEVER I WANT. BRING THEM BACK PLS!!!

instagram,'83.0',3/11/2019,5,I like Instagram and how many people it reaches.
instagram,'83.0',3/11/2019,5,Great way to share
instagram,'83.0',3/11/2019,1,Every 5 posts then a sponsored ad? Pretty annoying especially when someones personal profile is showings thats sponsored.
instagram,'83.0',3/11/2019,1,"The ads are ruining the entire app. The algorithm for the timeline is sickening, just let it fall chronologically. Every time I make a post on my private page I get a ton of spam DMs, friend requests, and even tagged photos. I saved all my pictures so I can delete the app."
instagram,'83.0',3/11/2019,2,Soo many bugs.. I just want to follow someone when I push follow......
instagram,'83.0',3/11/2019,5,tnQ
instagram,'83.0',3/11/2019,3,"First of all, I really Really dislike that the images are not in chronological order anymore so I wont see something one of my friends post until 3 days later sometimes :/ second of all, the newest update made the layout worst. The follow button is below the description now. It just looks ugly and displeasing to the eye. Please move it back. Also the layout as a whole has gotten less and less pleasing to look at as it slowly turns into nothing but a white screen with text and images and no unique design to it. The older versions with the blue outlines was way more unique and pleasing, but this newest update just makes me want to vomit every time I click on a profile and see the follow button under the description and not the follower count. Otherwise it works fine like it always has with the dms and posts."
instagram,'83.0',3/11/2019,5,Instagram is an app that you most have it any way because you have to know that's happening in world you are inside basically this is a good point but the bad point is you can't get out of it it's kinda a part of your mind you have to control your self in it
instagram,'83.0',3/11/2019,4,IG can be as private and simple as you want or public and complex. You choose. The interface is super easy to work with. It gets bugs like everything else but it works well. I just fill my feed with lots of positivity and art and it makes my day.  I only give 4 stars because they need to relax on the censoring or take context clues when it comes to censorship. Hate speech and crimes shouldn't have the same weight as nudity in art.
instagram,'83.0',3/11/2019,3,Make the viewers list not get deleted after 24 hrs  Think delet it does not make sense For some people is funny to see the new viewers on the highlights

instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,1,"One of my accounts was deactivated because of community guideline violations but on another account in which I had no violations on, the instagram app won't let me log in to it. I get an error message saying ""sorry we can't complete that request,"" or a message about the internet connection. I can log on to it on other devices so I know it is a problem within the app. I have tried deleting the app and redownloading it, logging in with a phone number and it won't even let me make a new account. I tried emailing support and they told me to go to the help website, same thing happened when I called customer service. Please reply to help resolve this problem asap."
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,4,"I used to be able to view Instagram stories on my iPad, but the most recent update seems to have broken playback. The audio plays normally but the video is stuck on the first frame of the story. IGTV seems to suffer from a similar glitch - the audio plays while the video remains on the static-y loading screen. Please look into this. Thanks!"
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,1,Being trying to speak with someone about my account and no one responds

instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,3,On the next update (which hopefully is soon!) could you make it so that you could kick people out of the Instagram group chats? You yourself can leave and you can add other people but it gets overcrowded and annoying when other friends add other people in it. Thank you and I hope that this is possible!
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,5,This is the best app ever
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,5,The Best

instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,3,"This is a great app, I love this platform but the thing I hate is that if you post multiple pictures, they all have to be the same size, and it cuts out parts of the picture. Can you please fix this where the photos can be their original size?"
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,1,IT KEEPS TAKING PEOPLES FOLLOWERS !!!!!?
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,1,"I have used Instagram multiple times, for multiple years. Just recently my account was either deleted or hacked but I got zero notification for either. I have tried deleting the actual app and re-installing it but it does not let me log into my account. Is there any way I can find out why this happened or why I was not notified of why I am not able to log in to my account anymore?"

Sadly I have sent numerous emails to support detailing the problem, as well as reported it many times through desktop. I have received no response on either end. Extremely disappointed."
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,3,When my act was hacked it took three months to fix. Horrible customer service. Amazon fixed inside if 10 minutes.

instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,1,Although it is a great app for sharing with your friends the quality of videos is quite bad and with the recent update your cannot go live with someone else without it glitching and freezing the whole time.
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,5,"I like em big, I like em chunky, I like em wide, I like em plumpy"

instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,2,"Your customer service needs improvement. I have reported my issues multiple times for months and have not been resolved. I cannot repost posts from other IG accounts to my stories. I also do not have the music feature. I have updated, re-downloaded and reported the issue. This is for my business account which I believe we should have features to."
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,3,When you click on a video on the explore page it loads the video beneath it and plays the video below while the screen stays on the video I clicked on.

instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,2,Instagram needs to make a native resolution app for iPad that works in landscape and portrait mode. Running an iPhone app with 2x button doe NOT make it an iPad app.
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,5,Its good for pictures and getting known
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,1,"It wont let me logjn my instagram @d.daanaee . it says "" Sorry, theres a problem with your request "" ."

instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,5,Thanks instagram ! I love you !!!
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,1,I liked Instagram until they made the feed no longer chronological. Now I miss my friends posts and only see ads. Instagram is a sellout I'm over it. They put the most liked posts first...like they need any extra exposure? I want to see the people I care about seeing in the order they post. Also Instagram algorithm has killed engagement for creatives leaving no incentive to even use the app anymore. Every time i have an issue i have never heard back from Instagram in the 6 years of having the app
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,5,This is a really cool app I can see lots of things I like keep it up instagram
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,5,good nice

instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,5,"Instagram is such an amazing app! It gives our generation motivation to explore different areas of the world, and our surroundings! The only social media app I use!"
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,4,IG is the way to go
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,4,"^^^^^ why am I losing followers. Please, fix it."
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,1,why is everybody rating that app 5 when they have many dislikes about it just like the stupid algorithm!!
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,1,its too bad that we cant see who's seen our story after 24H !!! its a big bug !
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,4,"I wish Instagram would open all of its cool and neat features to everyone not just people who have over 10,000 likes. Everyone should have freedom of authenticity to post in any means available. Such as the swipe up features and adding mini slide shows. Thanks!"
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,1,It logged me out of all my accounts
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,4,How do you go offline in the app? You used to be able to using the setting button on your profile page and the profile settings is now super simplified.
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,5,Fantastic
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,5,Ig is the best

instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,1,"Instagram is screwing up so bad right now. I can't see who I'm following, who follows me, the notifications, or even how many posts I have! This is unacceptable!!!"
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,3,"Fun social media application but does not review reports. Poor customer service. Please do not automatically take down my photos & videos without viewing the content prior! Also, there are many fake accounts pretending to be me and IG has done NOTHING about it."
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,5,This app is amazing! You can talk with your friends you can look at peoples photos and post your own! Do think it could be more appropriate though......
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,5,Love IG nothing more to say
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,5,Instagram is so good and I love it.This is a good app that i will always have.

instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,5,Love being able to post so easily!  Love instagram!!
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,3,I have a 6s & every time you upgrade you remove music and it takes me a few upgrades to get it back.
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,1,Still tracks my location even though I have not allowed it to do so. Thanks for respecting my wishes.
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,3,Used to love Instagram but the introduction of advertising and mining my likes to send me more ads is disappointing. Considering closing account.
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,1,i am literally about to delete this app because i have very high quality photos and when i upload them the quality becomes actual trash and i am sick and tired of it. even sometimes the quality is fine at first but then i go to the post a few days later and it is COMPLETELY DESTROYED. fix this asap!!!
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,5,Good
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,5,It is a good app to show your life
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,5,Love love
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,1,Why i cant post any thing on my feed?for 3days really????fix this problem please
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,1,Stop not giving us the choice of how we view pictures!!!! If you think it is such a great idea to create an algorithm of your choosing and not mine then let me choose!! But I can not because of your arrogance.  I want to see when/how long ago a friend posted a picture
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,2,I love Instagram but almost every time a new update comes something stops working. Right now I can't like or comment on post or reply to Instagram stories along with live stories. I can't even accept new follow request or follow people. I've been sending emails and reporting these problems for weeks now and it's still happening. I tried logging in online and that works but it doesn't work on the actual app.
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,5,Oh yeah insta is the best of the hole social media
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,2,Please stop screen recording my phone whenever I try to post. This makes me severely uncomfortable

instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,4,IG needs to become a free market place and not try and control commerce when it is made through ads
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,4,Ther has to b a bettr way to view stories or live vids. Thers pressure to view b4 they xpire / get replaced w new ones. I lov the feature that u can flag them and keep in tabs in jr profy

instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,5,I stay on instagram
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,5,Love that I have somewhere to post my pics
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,2,I like IG but hate the fact that they have control over when we can or cannot deactivate our accounts is just really frustrating! We should have full control over that at least. A reason could be anything yet you still have to wait a week! What if someone is threatening you and you just want to deactivate it? Now you have to wait a week!! Nonsense.
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,2,The new update removes all your views less than 24 hrs before your post expired. This is stupid and dumb. Fix it
instagram,'83.0',3/10/2019,5,I love Instagram it changed my life

instagram,'83.0',3/9/2019,5,"There should be an option after making a post to re-edit the post when there are multiple pictures in one. I would like to delete certain pictures from a post that contains more than picture. For example, if I made a post that had 4 pictures in it ; later on I would like to delete one of the 4 pictures but keep the post up with the remaining pictures."
instagram,'83.0',3/9/2019,1,Instagram is doing nothing about the fact that my account has been hacked and it is posting pornography. I already have a new account. I just want the old one taken down. Customer service is terrible with this company.
instagram,'83.0',3/9/2019,5,Instagram is the best marketing tool . I run several accounts.ore than FB & Twitter you get a faster ROI hete.

instagram,'83.0',3/9/2019,4,Good app but you guys need to have an option where people that made a post with multiple pictures can later on delete 1 or more of those pictures.

instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,1,"I live in the US and still have not been able to have the option of using the music sticker. This is disappointing because I know it launched in June 2018, but still only selected few have this option."
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,5,Instagram is incredible...very AWESOME
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,1,I was trying to download the app and it would not let me type on my code
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,1,It always glitches!!
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,1,Shadowbanned me for no reason and overall a bad app for that
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,5,It be tripping sometimes
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,2,"I have used Instagram many times before and it has worked perfectly fine until today. Every time I open the app and tried to post something it tells me that it will try to post when I have a better connection. I have full bars in both Internet connection and cellular connection and it will still not let me post. I have troubleshooted the phone several times restarting, and uninstalling and reinstalling the app."
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,1,I still cant log in
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,5,I love the ability to upload and share my photos with a very wide range of potential fans. I love the ability to build a family here online!
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,5,great for seeing what everyone is up to
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,4,Put it back to chronological order for timing of posts
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,5,I have enjoyed using Instagram for a while. The only issue that I have is that the features that get updated are not available for every device. I have an iPhone 8 Plus and I do not have the music feature on my Instagram. There are some other features like poll or questions that do not operate for other users that I know. Please fix. The bugs are annoying.
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,5,I think that a super useful feature to add would be allowing users to delete individual pictures from an already posted album.
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,2,Needs lots of upgrades
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,5,This is actually vibes and can be very pretty and vibey ya know what I mean?

instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,5,Love the app. Perfect for business marketing.
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,1,bring back chronological timeline.
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,5,I need more followers lol
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,1,"It isn't how is used to be. Although attempting to bring back a partial chronological order, it still controls content upload by not giving the user the full experience of expression. By controlling posts it minimizes a users exposure thereby hurting the user gaining optimal views. Entrepreneurs in particular who depend on page traffic are hurt the most. It is intrusive and right on disrespect to have a computers algorithm decide what I want to see and when. I've missed amazing events because a computer thinks I want to see my friends even hours after the fact. What is freedom of expression and true nature of freedom if my very content is controlled. This app will be as good as it was if there was less intrusion. 3/14/19 STILL THE SAME NONSENSE, BRING BACK CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER."
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,5,"dear instagram,  i would like it if you would put the unread button back because we need it thanks very much !!!!"
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,4,Please fix the multi photo option. It will not upload when I have 10 pictures.

instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,1,Instagram and Facebook has blocked me for absolutely no reason constantly. Should really consider adding something that shows when someone has unfollowed you. Too many people play the follow unfollow game

instagram,'84.0',3/16/2019,1,Was a good application until Facebook purchased the company.. Now nothing works :D
instagram,'83.0',3/16/2019,5,"This app is the new play ground for kids, basically the place were teenagers socialize, and an important part of an adult that wants to be updated about the latest trends, and more! In my class,  this app is literally essential! I recommend this app to all."
instagram,'84.0',3/16/2019,1,My music is not in my story like the sticker or music note sign what is wrong someone help
instagram,'84.0',3/16/2019,2,This update makes no sense and should be changed back.
instagram,'84.0',3/16/2019,5,Excellent
instagram,'84.0',3/16/2019,2,Love instagram... besides how low the quality gets when someone uploads a video...
instagram,'84.0',3/16/2019,1,"This is the 3rd week this app has stopped me from posting anything. I have a 2nd personal account where I constantly have problems, but never have trouble uploading on my business one. I keep sending reports with no respond. This is irritating and unprofessional!"
instagram,'84.0',3/16/2019,5,Won't load or refresh  Edit: they fixed it.
instagram,'84.0',3/16/2019,2,"We need viewer list back, please !!!"
instagram,'84.0',3/16/2019,2,"instagram definitely needs to fix things , starting off with the app being down at least once every 2 months & im tired of seeing nature/photography pics on my explore page out of no where. Also bring back the chronological order , yall made things confusing"
instagram,'84.0',3/16/2019,3,I love the app I just wish it was easier/made for an iPad
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,4,I would like to see who views my videos when I upload them.
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,1,"this is the worst app ,doesnt even work 90% of the time. instagram if u see this u sukk ballz and this is so extremely bad"
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,5,Make a night mode or dark mode
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,5,ur awesome!! the instagram quotes are inspiring
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,1,It died yesterday
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,1,Instagram was perfect. Why change something that has nothing wrong?  You all keep on putting up annoying ads and keep on asking me to rate insta
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,5,I love it
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,5,"Amazing app, but please make a way to link your account with other people so you can have many friends on a single account"

instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,5,Insta pretty great for content and to gain new customers because I put my work out as a barber
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,3,Oh course everyone loves IG but the most annoying update is not being able to see my posts in the order that they are posted. At times you will never get to see certain posts. No one wants to turn post notifications on. Your phone would go crazy with notifications.
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,5,Start fixing yall app plz and thx if yall do
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,5,Love IG.. easy way to upload pictures and share to other social sites.
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,5,Comes and goes!!
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,2,During the outage earlier this week I thought I was a glitch on my end so I deleted and reinstalled the app. Now it will not let me log back into my account. It just sits there on the loading screen and then freezes. I have turned my phone off several times and have again uninstalled and reinstalled the app with no success. This is very frustrating and I would like to access my account again via the iPhone app.
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,1,See title.
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,3,Love this app but had to lose some stars bc i wish instagram went back to chronological order. Please bring that back Instagram
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,3,Needs dark mode
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,3,When I first got it it was way to hard I was really mad! But I am getting the hang of this so I will see if I could get a better hang of it than what I have right now
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,1,I baby post anything come on
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,2,"I was scrolling through the Explore page. Reading funny memes, watching cool BTS videos of Game of Thrones, when suddenly I guess an auto update installed, and my whole explore feed turned to pictures of landscapes and interior designing. What the heck???"
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,4,it says its updated but my account still looks like the old update compares to my friends
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,1,I am not receiving direct message notifications.
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,5,I love this app. It is so cool you should get it now
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,4,chill out w the updates my dude it was fine before
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,1,Not much more to say than that... Based on the format I am going to say this is probably for the iPhone. It is a pretty terrible user experience on the iPad.
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,5,I love Instagram so much
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,4,5 stars would= fewer ads
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,1,When I want to send a post to someone it shows group chats that I have left and when I send someone a lot of post they become the top person to send things to but for some reason it always resets after a week. This time when it reseted it shows people that I never talk to or rarely talk to and group chats that I don't talk to and group chats that I have left. Please fix this it's so stupid and annoying. On iPhone 8plus.
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,1,Why is it just showin stuff that popular in my area??? Show me memes!
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,3,Crashes Way Too Much

instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,1,"Instagram has become my least favorite app, what is the point of seeing a post from 2 weeks ago then one from an hour ago?! Whoever took away chronological order on this app is an idiot and twitter is the best! Also i would rather not see everyones fake life they have to make look perfect for Instagram likes"
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,4,"Hi I love the app but stop doing these updates that screw things up, thanks"
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,5,I love my instagram. It has brought many great friends into my life that I never would have met...

instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,1,I cannot receive any notification from this app :(
instagram,'18.0',3/14/2019,1,"Instagram deleted one of my accounts for no reason. I never posted on it, nor did i ever comment on it. They just deleted it, and gave no reason for its deletion. ALSO Instagram has ZERO customer service, and I have nobody that works for Instagram to reach out to about my erroneously deleted account. Don't waste your time with Instagram, use Facebook instead."
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,5,it cool
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,1,Fix ur app
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,5,Yesterday was really horrible but glad it is fixed! Instagram is my favorite app to use
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,5,Cool app but that down time was not the move
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,5,This is a very creative & informative way of staying in touch with people around us.
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,2,"I believe Instagram should bring back the feature where you can see who viewed your highlights after 24 hours. For marketing purposes , this was important to me and instagram has decreased in value (for me and coworkers) since then."
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,1,Keeps Crashing When uploading multiple pictures.
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,5,"Great, easy to use social media platform with an uncluttered layout."

instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,1,Still having difficulty with Instagram
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,5,I like this
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,1,Meh
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,1,App is not working
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,4,Since Facebook bought out Instagram it seems we have another Facebook and what was so great about Instagram is gone. The algorithm and blocking people from viewing your posts just so you pay to promote your posts has destroyed the Instagram experience. And users are going elsewhere!
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,2,Why would you get rid of focus mode
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,4,The app is great but it be nice to be able to favorite gifs or add most used gifs di we can find them easier
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,3,It is bugged very much its like it is shot fix plz
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,3,"After paying for advertisements, regular engagement seems to drop tremendously as if it was being throttled. This could be just a side effect of the algorithm or it could be a way to get more money up out of advertisers, but either way it seems a little weird. IG is a cool app, I enjoy using it but I wish there was a way to separate followings and followers into lists besides the close friends option."
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,5,"I use it occasionally good for what it is, only issue I ever have is ridiculous drama like people get upset for advice or other nonsense like naughty people message me with inappropriate websites anyway Instagram is pretty good nice to share events that happen or photos I find."
instagram,'84.0',3/14/2019,2,Music sticker disappeared.  Reloaded multiple times and nothing.   Now stories are just boring.    FIX!!!

instagram,'84.0',3/16/2019,1,This app is gay and i hate the fact that my account got banned for no reason i posted a pic and i got banned for no reason so can i get my account back
instagram,'84.0',3/16/2019,5,I love it
instagram,'84.0',3/16/2019,5,"Every time I add a story, it no longer gives me an option to put it in a highlight."
instagram,'84.0',3/16/2019,3,miss the feature of being able to see who has viewed your stories after the 24 hours is up and the algorithm is out of wack
instagram,'84.0',3/16/2019,4,"I want to be able to see who has viewed my Instagram Story Highlights. It says the view list disappears after 24 hours. But if I choose to put my story as a highlight on my profile I should be able to see who views it from time to time. Other than that, love the app. Also please fix the order of posts."

instagram,'84.0',3/16/2019,2,"Instagram is a great application for communication, and to help us connect with people we love . It is especially convenient for college students to keep in touch with their family members.  However , it needs a dark mode like youtube , iMDb , and Netflix. White can really hurt the eyes in the dark . Dark mode makes me love accessing applications. But with instagram, I think twice before I sacrifice my eyes comfort .   Please make a dark mode guys ."

instagram,'84.0',3/16/2019,5,I love Instagram with all my heart and would never delete it. Instagram is filled with people that make you feel like there either really good friends or family. I have made some really good friends on there. And sometimes I can think of it as a type of home.

instagram,'84.0',3/16/2019,5,"Excellent , my family loves Instagram"
instagram,'84.0',3/16/2019,2,"I love Instagram as a way to connect with my friends and associates, however Im growing increasingly frustrated with this issue!  If a user follows me and I would like to follow them back, or I would like to follow someone new, I go to that users page, hit the follow button, then however, the follow button de-selects itself/malfunctions, therefore leaving me not able to follow other users.  In an attempt to remedy this issue myself, I have performed the following actions: I have tried turning my phone off and restarting (I have an iPhone 6S+) I have made sure my phone has been updated per Apple I have signed out and re-signed in to my account (multiple times) I have un-installed and re-installed the app (multiple times)  This has been going on for over a year, and I have reached out approximately 4 times, and I have not yet received a response."
instagram,'84.0',3/16/2019,1,"This app is too psychologically addicting to healthily use on a daily basis. You make a life for yourself within an application, and neglect the one around you. The application also is designed to delay notifications and modify when pictures are shown to others to get you hooked by a huge influx of likes and then slowly but surely taking that from you as you get less and less likes keeping you hooked. This application should be fine for adults with the ability to see this and understand it, but should be restricted to a certain age."
instagram,'84.0',3/16/2019,1,The feed is still out of chronological order and the app will prompt for a review.

instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,1,Good quality pictures turn into really bad quality once they are posted :((( please fix!!
instagram,'84.0',3/15/2019,2,"I can't seem to get the posts to display in the order they were posted. Even Facebook has that option. And no way to manually clear the cache? Add chronological view and cache clearing and it'll be a worthwhile app.  In the last few days suddenly my feed is BURIED in ads, one every 5 or so posts. Some have gross-out blackhead peels, naked butts, and drug advertising. I'm not necessarily against those things, but don't they seem like the thing people should be able to opt out of seeing? Just because I follow beauty accounts doesn't mean I want to see plugged up grease being dragged out of someone's face.  Hiding irrelevant ads does nothing...the app has decided I lived in Arizona and no amount of hiding local ads from AZ companies will do any good. The horror tag gives a BS warning about self harm (guess people who like scary movies all hate themselves?) And you can't opt out of the annoying new ""You're all caught up!"" feature"

Ever since they added advertisements to the feed, literally EVERY THIRD POST in the newsfeed is an ad!"

instagram,'49.0',3/17/2019,2,"This is a great app but there is some bugs I know of. I think you need to update it soon!!!!! Whenever I follow someone it unfollows them 1 second later for some reason. After you follow a certain amount of people this happens. It is kind of annoying. Max is 7500 following. And you can follow 250 in a short period of time from my experience. This app has some lag issues at some times. Mostly with loading pictures or uploading stories. I hate that there is only a limited amount of hashtags you can add in a post! Why would having more than 30 hashtags be a problem?!!!??!???? One other thing I hate about this app is that you cant skip through videos and it is easy to back out of a video if you touch your screen by accident. So, this app is decent just annoying at times."

instagram,'85.0',3/18/2019,1,how come you can a longer see how many pictures a person has posted?
instagram,'85.0',3/18/2019,5,"Overall, I really like the app. If you could make 1 change to where you can send your saved playlists to people, that would be so much helpful and easier! I hate to send separate photos or videos that I saved instead of sending the whole playlist. Please make that an option."
instagram,'85.0',3/18/2019,5,Great social media app
instagram,'85.0',3/18/2019,1,Often times when you record a video on the Instagram app after it is posted there will be no sound fix that what do they pay you to do over there

instagram,'85.0',3/18/2019,4,"I have a personal account and a business account. I use my business account to promote my small business on Etsy and it would really help me if I could put an active link in my stories. I read somewhere that you can do it if you have like 10,000 followers, but that does not make sense because the people that need the sales boost are the people who still have to grow.  Please let any business account add active links to their stories!!"
instagram,'85.0',3/18/2019,5,"No, no, no.   It was waaayyyyyyy better like before, not with the profile picture on the left. . ."

instagram,'85.0',3/18/2019,1,"This is bologna, you can no longer see who viewed your story after 24hours? Huge hit to my business profile insights. Plus layout of profiles in the update is not satisfying at all."

instagram,'85.0',3/18/2019,1,I only use this thing for the ppl to see my letters to them. Otherwise I do not support it as long as they censor and promote censorship. They are bias politically and push ppl who pay money.
instagram,'85.0',3/18/2019,5,love the app but please get rid of the new update where the profile fronts are awkward

instagram,'85.0',3/18/2019,1,"Every time I try adding other accounts (I have only 3 active now), it says that maximum accounts are active. ITS BEEN ALMOST A WEEK! fix this."
instagram,'85.0',3/18/2019,5,"Very nice app, out of all the things I have downloaded on my phone this app is always the most smooth working. Occasionally I have a refresh problem, but other than that good job keep it up!"
instagram,'85.0',3/18/2019,5,"I really love instagram and all the fun things it has provided for us, I just wish i could edit more. For instance like when i post multiple pictures , lets say three and i choose the cover picture, I wish I could edit and change the cover picture when I wanted to."
instagram,'85.0',3/18/2019,3,"I love this app, but unless someone fixes the commenting, caption area, and the music button for the story.. nothing is gonna get better. Until I see improvement I am giving 3 stars only."

instagram,'85.0',3/18/2019,1,I do not like the new profile format at all. I like for people to be able to read my whole bio without having to click on it. I do like that the follower count is smaller though.
instagram,'84.0',3/18/2019,1,The new profile layout of unnecessary. Why did it have to be changed. No one asked for it. Change it back to how it was. All the changes are pointless.
instagram,'85.0',3/18/2019,1,Hey. Change the update back to the previous version. The profile setup is dumb.   Thanks
instagram,'85.0',3/18/2019,3,I very much dislike the new update with the accounts. It looks like it was made in 2009. I prefer the older follow message thing
instagram,'85.0',3/18/2019,5,Love it each time I can put my face on different stuff

instagram,'85.0',3/19/2019,1,"Bring back chronological order already jeez! I don't even use instagram anymore for posts! People don't see mine and i don't see theirs! Fix this already.  Also, change back the profile setup! You changed it today or yesterday and it's ugly and hides half of my bio! What the heck! Stop updating unnecessarily. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"
instagram,'85.0',3/19/2019,1,My account keeps sending me an error message anytime I try to like/comment or write captions. I have restarted the app removed my blog link from my profile and it still is giving me this Error message. I have reached out to IG several times and I get no response. Please advise
instagram,'85.0',3/19/2019,1,IG think that they are big brother.

instagram,'85.0',3/19/2019,1,"Many accounts actually buying fake fans to follow them, which is the incentive for these accounts exists. Instagram should not only use machine learning to filter and block these fake spam accounts; any accounts buying fake fans should also be checked and punished."

instagram,'85.0',3/19/2019,3,Instagram should do a update that allows you to delete multiple pics at one time. I want to clean my page but I have over 1600 pics and it will take me forever to do it one at a time!!
instagram,'85.0',3/19/2019,5,Validation and self expression are cool. But I dont like my psychology being taken advantage of
instagram,'85.0',3/19/2019,5,Instagram is good time pass and nice way to connect to ppl and celebrities
instagram,'85.0',3/19/2019,1,I am so sick of IG not being in chronological order. My friend passed away last night and I want to see if anyone posted about him. Instead all I see is celebrity and meme pages.

instagram,'85.0',3/19/2019,5,I was wondering
instagram,'85.0',3/19/2019,5,Instagram you rock keep doing what you do!!
instagram,'85.0',3/19/2019,5,Ok
instagram,'85.0',3/19/2019,3,"I love Instagram and all of the new features being consistently released! However, there is a serious lack of app support or customer service in the event something is not working. For example, the music feature in Instagram stories has never worked for me since it has been released. It works on my personal account, but not my business account. I have deleted and re-downloaded my app, logged in and out of my account, upgraded to the latest version, etc. and I am using an iPhone X. My phone is up to date and I have switched my account back and forth from business to personal. Since nothing worked, I turned to the Instagram help which is only a FAQ database with no help on this subject. Beyond that, besides reporting errors which I have done multiple times, there is no way to connect with customer service to resolve an issue, so my app continues to work incorrectly. Can you please add in app support and in the meantime help me resolve this issue? Also, I wish the face filters on the app were more interactive and included location stickers/tags. Thank you!"
instagram,'85.0',3/19/2019,1,The main feed isn't chronological.

instagram,'85.0',3/22/2019,2,Ever since Instagram was down I am no longer receiving notifications. I have checked all of my notification settings and they are all on but I am still not receiving and notifications.

instagram,'85.0',3/22/2019,1,"I only left a one star to hopefully get someone's attention to the need for a larger screen support.

instagram,'85.0',3/22/2019,5,"Hear it from me..I'm literally on level 4,400! been playing since the beginning.   This week I got a new phone, I backed up the phone of course but when it was all back up and running, Candycrush had changed..now they charge you a life if you don't like the layout of the level and want to opt out before making a move. Before that NEVER happened..or if you accidentally click on an old level and opt out of it..same thing..a life wasted again. Obviously it's because they want more control over you losing so that you'll purchase lives or other items from them which is super sad...So I'm finally done with this game.  Side note...over 4,000 levels over the last 7 years completed...ONLY 1 time hitting the ""jackpot"" on the wheel. It's all rigged folks."
instagram,'85.0',3/22/2019,2,Not sure whether this is an apple problem or instagram but I have tried restarting my phone and making sure push notifications are on and I have even tried restarting my phone completely as well as delete and reinstalling instagram but I still do not get notifications for direct message and need that fixed please.

instagram,'85.0',3/22/2019,1,"To whom it may concern, my account has been disabled and I am not sure why. I think this is a mistake because I have never violated any terms of the app. There was no warning that my account is being disabled. I have spent countless days building the page, and now it has been taken for no reason. I have tried contacting multiple times, but never received any response and my account is still not activated. If you check, you will see I did nothing wrong. Please help me. Thank you"

I stopped using my account for a bit during exams and when I came back I found a feature in the settings to see the past posts I double tapped on.

instagram,'85.0',3/21/2019,4,"I love the app don't get me wrong i just have a request. I would greatly appreciate it if we could report a DM or DM request that someone sends you. I have gotten some very disturbing DM requests and nothing has been done about it I try to report the account for something as close to it as possible but it doesn't typically help. So, I block them but I don't want anyone else to fall for what these people are saying and trying to drag you into. I have gotten a DM from someone who wanted to be my ""sugar daddy"" and sent a number. I just don't want anyone especially young users to fall for this it is gross and i would like to get people like this accounts removed for being inappropriate. Thank you."
instagram,'85.0',3/21/2019,2,I am tired of being blocked from commenting FOR NO REASON. I am tired of there being ZERO REAL ASSISTANCE for constant problems. You need to do better. The app has gotten too huge for you to continue to ignore the problem. I see bots and trolls leaving comments and likes by THE THOUSANDS yet they never seem to get banned. Enough is enough.

instagram,'85.0',3/21/2019,1,"I love IG just like anyone else, but this new update makes everything look so boring and mundane, i want to know how many posts people have, i want to see whos viewed my stories. Why does it vanish after 24 hours? Why cant i see how many posts a profile has? Boringggg"
instagram,'85.0',3/21/2019,5,Yes
instagram,'85.0',3/20/2019,4,In a recent update IG took away information regarding the specific (top 5) hashtags that were creating the most traffic/impressions on each post. Having this information is vital to how I market my business. If this is added back this would definitely be a 5 star review.

instagram,'83.0',3/6/2019,3,Not loving the new algorithms. Way harder to find and follow people organically.
instagram,'83.0',3/6/2019,3,Recently there has been a lot of horrible ads being promoted by Instagram but among the worst are sponsored posts from literal middle and high school kids just trying to gain followers.... I think this is clearly taking advantage of kids and setting up very harmful ideals of what they should value.... please do something about this.
instagram,'83.0',3/6/2019,3,What the hell is wrong with the post notification? I get at least three notifications for the SAME post someone I follow makes. Please fix this it is super annoying.   Also I always get live notification from someone I never interact with but no notification from someone I really care about. Can you improve your algorithm?

instagram,'83.0',3/6/2019,4,"I love Instagram and I'm on it all the time. My only comment would be to be able to edit the photos differently. Like on a post, you can edit out some of the photos. If you have more than one photo, you could get rid of one of them and keep the other ones."
instagram,'83.0',3/6/2019,4,I wish I could get the real App Store version instead of the ITunes brbn.instagram one. Apple needs to fix the bugs that allow such issues.

instagram,'83.0',3/6/2019,3,"I began using IG instead of FB because of all the pop-up ads. Now I have the same issue with IG. Ads appear instead of posts from people I follow. My page is supposed to be private so apparently I have allowed the content to be used for commercial purposes in the long agreements that I didn't read, buyer/user beware. So I may have to take a social media break from it all. And, the posts from my real friends sporadically appears because I have made the mistake in judgement to follow so ""celebrities"" and it seems their content may take precedence?"

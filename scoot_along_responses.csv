I feel like the main concern with the bike share options in the District were that you were dock-bound, meaning it was harder to get to certain places or harder to plan your routes around the docks. The dockless bike share options solved this. So why scooters? There's no benefit to using these over bikes - in fact, it's introducing more problems because they're too fast for sidewalks but too slow and bulky for bike/traffic lanes, and people are leaving them just anywhere they get tired of them. It seems like this was solving a problem that didn't exist, or it was the motorized scooter lobby (lol I hope this is a thing that truly exists) pushing for more sales and convincing these bike share companies that scooters would be a good idea. It doesn't seem like the companies gave the dockless bike shares enough time to exist in these city spaces before introducing scooters as another option for users who still weren't satisfied. Give me the data that says these are better/easier to use than dockless bikes! It's just a segway but for 90s kids who weren't rich enough to have a personal motorized scooter when they were younger!
